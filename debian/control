Description: libraries for CPU and heap analysis, plus an efficient thread-caching malloc
 The gperftools, previously called google-perftools, package contains some
 utilities to improve and analyze the performance of C++ programs.  This
 includes an optimized thread-caching malloc() and cpu and heap profiling
 utilities.  The devel package contains static and debug libraries and header
 files for developing applications that use the google-perftools package.
